# Raven CLI bridge

## Self integration on nominal main (2026-09-30)

Self is integrated independently of `codex/structural-types`. Raven projects must
select `RavenTargetPlatform=NeoCLR` and configure the fieldless
`System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Self` marker in `NeoCLR.CoreProbe`. The shared
props do this. Raven's .NET target rejects that configuration with RAVT003.

The importer replaces the marker with native Self and admits bounded Number and
Clonable generic dispatch, including borrowed receivers. See
[self contracts](self-types.md) and [the consumer](experiments/native-self/README.md)
for inheritance and current importer restrictions. A real neoCLR metadata layer
must replace marker recognition with native contract identity/signatures; it must
preserve conformance ownership, substitution and unsupported-use diagnostics.
Compiler binding/diagnostics belong to Raven; CLI translation is owned by
`docs/experiments/raven-target` and native validation/dispatch by `src/self_types.rs`.

The nominal delegate ABI still uses Func with an inhabited Void result. This is
required even without structural Functions; Raven retains that bridge encoding.
Structural identity, Function introspection and structural assignability remain on
feature branches in both repositories. Do not use a Function-branch bundle as
acceptance evidence for this integration. General core, unit, tuple, iteration,
propagation and typeof encodings remain described in Raven's
`docs/compiler/neoclr-cli-bridge.md`; this CLI bridge is not a native metadata loader.

## Structural experiment branch

This checkout is `codex/structural-types`, based on the Self-integrated main.
Its existing structural Function implementation and API are retained, independently
of main's nominal delegates. Function identity/metadata work is still experimental;
Self support is inherited from main. Use this branch's matching generated core,
bridge and native library, not a nominal main bundle.
