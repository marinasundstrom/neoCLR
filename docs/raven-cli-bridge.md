# Raven CLI bridge

## Self integration on nominal main (2026-09-30)

Self is integrated independently of `codex/structural-types`. Raven projects must
select `RavenTargetPlatform=NeoCLR` and configure the fieldless
`System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Self` marker in `NeoCLR.CoreProbe`. The shared
props do this. Raven's .NET target rejects that configuration with RAVT003.

The importer replaces the marker with native Self and admits bounded Number and
Clonable generic dispatch, including borrowed receivers. See
[self contracts](self-types.md) and [the consumer](experiments/native-self/README.md)
for inheritance and current importer restrictions. A real neoCLR metadata layer
must replace marker recognition with native contract identity/signatures; it must
preserve conformance ownership, substitution and unsupported-use diagnostics.
Compiler binding/diagnostics belong to Raven; CLI translation is owned by
`docs/experiments/raven-target` and native validation/dispatch by `src/self_types.rs`.

The nominal delegate ABI still uses Func with an inhabited Void result. This is
required even without structural Functions; Raven retains that bridge encoding.
Structural identity, Function introspection and structural assignability remain on
feature branches in both repositories. Do not use a Function-branch bundle as
acceptance evidence for this integration. General core, unit, tuple, iteration,
propagation and typeof encodings remain described in Raven's
`docs/compiler/neoclr-cli-bridge.md`; this CLI bridge is not a native metadata loader.

## Native metadata exploration (2026-09-30)

The [extended CLI metadata design](design/extended-cli-metadata.md) starts on
`codex/extended-cli-metadata` from main. It includes structural type identity,
synthesized members, explicit capabilities and a staged Raven importer/emitter path.
The [standalone codec and bounded PE probe](experiments/extended-cli-metadata/README.md)
now transport #Neo for inspection. .NET and Cecil read conventional metadata unchanged,
but Cecil rewriting strips the stream. Do not route native metadata through an ordinary
Cecil rewrite without preservation/remapping support. Current marker/carrier behavior
and Runtime Contract configuration remain as described above. No native runtime-loaded
artifact or Raven compiler bundle is validated by this experiment.

The [reader/writer architecture](design/extended-cli-metadata.md#reader-and-writer-support-on-net-and-neoclr)
plans a .NET-hosted metadata library for Raven and corresponding support on neoCLR,
including a guest-accessible library. Format codecs, semantic resolution and Raven
symbol/emission adapters remain separate; the current bridge is not that library.

The [provisional recognition contract](experiments/extended-cli-metadata/README.md#marked-artifact-recognition-2026-09-30)
requires an explicit expected-extended input profile, a metadata-root marker and a
matching stream digest. Future Raven native-metadata loading must reject failures
without falling back to carrier/ordinary CLI interpretation; ordinary .NET targeting
remains separate. This is a Python probe contract, not an implemented Raven loader.

## Independent metadata consumer, stage 1 (2026-09-30)

Raven's `codex/metadata-consumer` at `7e18edb66` adds an opt-in
`tools/NeoClrMetadataProbe` consumer of the independent metadata library. The frontend
uses the existing .NET provider and default runtime contract to bind primitive Int32
source and an API-produced PE library. A compiler-side public-operations adapter emits
the application as native format-5 JSON through the metadata API. The dependency is
also emitted natively by that API. neoCLR loads/verifies both and returns 42.
The application does not go through the existing CLI import bridge.

This is a staged bootstrap, not a new Runtime Contract option or a completed native
ICompilationEmitter/ISemanticDataLoader. The PE dependency and host-core identity are
temporary inputs to the .NET frontend. Native top-level functions have no artificial
user type. Only required Int32 values, returns, primitive unchecked/unlifted arithmetic,
local calls and the explicit static dependency are supported. Other constructs and
unresolved methods are rejected; attributes, defaults, debug data and structural
contracts are not silently advertised as preserved. Parameter names/source mappings
are not yet emitted by the native subset.

Ownership remains Raven symbols/operations/adapters -> separate metadata model/format
library -> native runtime loader/verifier/VM. The next stages replace the .NET metadata
bootstrap with native symbol loading, integrate target diagnostics/configuration, and
expand ordinary format support using this executable consumer. Shared operations and
missing-Param-row fixes are general Raven corrections, already fast-forwarded to local
main as `1ea0ca263` and `d7040e21d`; the consumer remains experimental.

Validation: the .NET 10 consumer runs the native output to 42 and rejects unsupported
division plus an unresolved method. Raven's .NET 11 operations/default-parameter filter
passes 87 tests; two invocation and one missing-parameter-row regression failed before
the fixes. Compiler builds pass for .NET 10/11. See
[hash evidence](experiments/extended-cli-metadata/raven-compiler-validation.json) and
[reproduction](experiments/extended-cli-metadata/README.md#raven-compiler-consumer-stage-1).
No full native target, structural execution, NanoFramework or release is claimed.

### Read-only call imports — 2026-09-30

The independent host library now provides `AssemblyBuilder.ImportReference` and
`MethodBuilder.Call(ImportedMethodReference)`. This follows the existing Cecil-style
import direction: a compiler consumes immutable definitions and imports a scoped
reference into its output. Compared with CLR reflection/Reflection.Emit, this needs
no loaded runtime assembly or executable method handle. Compared with full Cecil
imports it deliberately supports only unsigned, top-level-owner static Int32/void
signatures; no generic substitution, access checking or arbitrary IL translation.
The cost is an explicit host assertion of the dependency core contract and a bounded
format-5 naming agreement. Private reference-only nodes reuse both writers' existing
call encodings without retaining producer bodies. A future general signature model
should replace these bounded nodes as supported compiler cases require it.

Raven's feature-branch probe now receives only the read-only dependency snapshot;
it does not receive its builder graph. The primitive .NET Runtime Contract remains
the binding bootstrap, and ordinary .NET code generation is unchanged. Native
semantic-data loading and production emitter installation remain the next integration
stages; structural support stays later. C# contract tests pass (22 groups); both the
native global-function gate and Raven probe verify/run to 42. Missing dependency,
wrong revision, unsupported operation and binding diagnostics remain checked.

### Compiler-owned native adapter checkpoint — 2026-09-30

The working operations consumer is now the optional `Raven.CodeAnalysis.NeoClr`
project, with `NeoClrCompilationEmitter.Emit`, immutable output/core/dependency options
and a success/diagnostic result. The probe is a C# caller of this reusable adapter.
The metadata API remains a separate project with no Raven dependency. The new project
is opt-in through NeoClrMetadataProject; ordinary .NET behavior/default builds and
`Compilation.Emit` composition are unchanged.

Calls use explicit compiler-reference-to-snapshot bindings and resolved assembly-symbol
identity instead of a simple-name selection. Host snapshot consistency and the primitive
core assertion remain explicit responsibilities until a native provider owns them.
NEOMETA001 carries source locations; NEOMETA002 rejects incompatible configuration;
NEOMETA003 reports writer limits/invalid graphs. Original binding diagnostics survive.
All validation precedes output writes; host I/O failures propagate and can partially
write. Supported source/format-5 encoding remains the existing static Int32 subset.

C# consumer checks cover expression spans, unchanged rejected output, original error
identities, invalid/duplicate/unregistered/core bindings, writer limits, multi-tree
rejection, repeated output and stream ownership/failure. The emitted application still
verifies/runs in neoCLR with result 42. Hash evidence includes the new adapter binary.
Native symbol loading and production target registration remain pending. Structural
support remains later; this does not change the runtime bridge's platform capabilities.

### Multi-file native adapter checkpoint — 2026-09-30

The optional compiler-owned emitter now accepts multiple source trees. It collects
all supported top-level declarations before emitting bodies and retains each body's
own semantic model. Like the ordinary .NET compiler, valid cross-file calls bind
independently of file order; native metadata token/declaration order still follows
input order. No shared binding or .NET emitter change was required. Macro trees and
unsupported constructs remain excluded under the existing explicit bootstrap contract.

The new two-file regression first failed with the adapter's NEOMETA002 single-tree
restriction. After the refactor, Helper.rvn/Main.rvn and the reversed input order
both verify/run to 42 in neoCLR. A division expression in the later helper file
produces NEOMETA001 with that file's source location and leaves output unchanged.
The original one-file and adapter contract checks still pass. Validation evidence
includes hashes for all three applications. Native symbol loading and production
registration remain separate next steps; the metadata library stays independent.

The tested adapter source is committed on Raven `codex/metadata-consumer` at
`03705e88b` (adapter extraction `dc84dd07b`). The native runtime and independent
metadata library remain on neoCLR `codex/extended-cli-metadata`; the paired binary
and output hashes are in `docs/experiments/extended-cli-metadata/raven-compiler-validation.json`.

### Native dependency input through a reference projection — 2026-09-30

The independent metadata project now reads its bounded native format-5 declaration
contract with `NativeAssemblyDefinition.ReadAssembly`. It checks manifest/name/origin
consistency, duplicate and unsupported declaration fields, owner/signature contracts
and resource bounds. Bodies remain opaque: successful metadata reading does not imply
successful native verification or execution. General native schemas, arbitrary types,
structural metadata and executable rewriting remain unsupported.

The snapshot can create a reference-only PE using an explicit core identity. The
projection preserves supported callable/type declarations and marks the assembly with
ReferenceAssemblyAttribute; placeholder bodies throw. It omits the native entry point
and implementation dependency references. These signatures need only primitive types.
This is the temporary native-input bridge, following the .NET separation of compilation
contracts and executable implementations, not a new executable CLI representation of
native code. The cost is an extra PE and the existing .NET symbol provider. Native
ISemanticDataLoader/symbol construction should ultimately consume native declarations
directly; the projection must then be retired, not made a permanent platform rule.
Primary comparison: [Microsoft reference assemblies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/reference-assemblies).

The Raven probe now emits only the original native dependency from its producer,
reads that native artifact, and creates MetadataProbeLibrary.reference.dll from the
reader. It binds that reference with the existing .NET primitive Runtime Contract,
imports the read-only callable contract, and emits native applications. The original
native dependency (never the reference PE) is supplied to neoCLR. The one-file and
both two-file orders verify/run to 42; diagnostic/stream checks still pass. The report
records the reference projection hash alongside the native dependency/application hashes.

Ownership: the metadata project owns reading/projection; Raven owns compiler binding
and emission; the host supplies matching explicit core identities and native runtime
dependencies. Ordinary .NET defaults and existing CLI targets are unchanged. The
metadata project stays separate, and all work remains on the existing feature branches.
C# contracts pass (23 groups), including malformed inputs, projection ownership,
reference marking and rejection of execution loading by .NET. No production native
semantic loader or target registration is claimed.

### Raven library-to-application native case — 2026-09-30

Both sides of the integration case now originate in Raven source. The optional adapter
accepts library output without an entry point and public nongeneric static classes in
the global namespace containing public static Int32 methods. Ordinary Raven default
public method accessibility is accepted. Nonpublic members/types/library globals and
additional type contracts are rejected; the public-only metadata writer must not
silently widen a library's visibility. Console top-level functions remain native
functions outside types. Broader visibility/namespace/type support is still pending.

The producer declares MathLibrary.Twice overloads and a Multiply helper. Raven emits
the library as native format 5; the independent metadata API reads it and projects
reference-only declarations. A separate Raven application binds the one-argument
overload, emits a native external call, and neoCLR executes the original library's
local helper call. The one-file and both multi-file input orders return 42. No producer
builder graph or hand-authored native dependency body is used in the case.

The new case first failed with NEOMETA002 because the adapter accepted only console
output. Focused C# checks now confirm entry-less library output, overload/local-call
execution, source-located visibility/type rejection with unchanged output, and native
missing-dependency/wrong-revision errors. Existing diagnostic/stream and multi-file
checks pass. The .NET primitive Runtime Contract and reference-only input bridge remain
explicit; no default .NET behavior, general binder, metadata library API or runtime
format change was needed. The next replacement remains a native semantic provider and
production target composition, with further supported constructs driven by real cases.

This checkpoint uses Raven `codex/metadata-consumer` source commit `907fb0596`
and the independent metadata API on neoCLR `codex/extended-cli-metadata`
(`cfd7ed50` reader/projection implementation). Matching binary and artifact hashes
are retained in `docs/experiments/extended-cli-metadata/raven-compiler-validation.json`.

### Transitive native runtime acceptance — 2026-09-30

The end-to-end chain now consists entirely of Raven-compiled native assemblies:
application -> MetadataProbeLibrary -> ArithmeticDependency. The outer library imports
the inner library's native declarations through the temporary reference projection.
The application references only the outer projection; Arithmetic is absent from its
symbol lookup and the outer reference PE's AssemblyRef rows, since all public
signatures use primitives. Like .NET reference assemblies, implementation dependencies
remain outside that compile-time signature surface. They are still required at runtime.

`NativeAssemblyDefinition.References` now exposes the exact direct native identities
in manifest order as an owned read-only list. It does not resolve dependencies or build
a transitive closure. The host explicitly supplies both native dependencies to neoCLR.
The existing runtime reference validator (`src/references.rs` in neoCLR), loader,
verifier and VM accept the emitted chain: all three application variants return 42,
and reversed runtime module order also returns 42. Missing direct/transitive modules
and wrong direct/transitive revisions fail verification with the expected diagnostics.
No runtime implementation change was necessary for this supported format-5 graph.

This is actual loading and execution of the emitted native format, not a claim based
on PE readability or reader roundtrips. Reference-only PEs are compiler input only.
The author reiterated runtime loading as a required acceptance gate. Direct PE/#Neo
loading and structural NEOX semantics are still unimplemented, and the .NET primitive
binding bootstrap remains temporary. Neither limitation is hidden by this test.

Validation: 24 C# metadata contract groups pass, including direct identity/list
ownership and rejection checks; Raven adapter/library/multi-file contracts pass; the
runtime checks above pass. Reports include both native dependencies and both reference
projection hashes. Compiler integration remains on codex/metadata-consumer and the
independent metadata/runtime checkout on codex/extended-cli-metadata.

## Direct PE/#Neo runtime bridge — 2026-09-30

The optional Raven adapter now offers `EmitMetadataAssembly`, backed by the separate
.NET metadata project. It requires the existing explicit .NET primitive bootstrap,
output/core identities and registered dependency snapshots; no Runtime Contract
configuration or default target behavior changes. Runtime-native declarations and
bodies occupy required section 256/schema 1. CLI declarations remain a reference-only
compiler projection; neoCLR reads the native section directly from the same PE files.
Owners remain Raven for semantic mapping/diagnostics, the metadata project for encoding
and projections, and neoCLR for admission/linking/verification/execution.

This replaces separate PE/JSON packaging in the end-to-end case, but not JSON encoding
inside the section. Native symbol loading, binary payload encoding and wider semantic
coverage will replace the remaining bridge in stages. No performance gain is claimed.
Both module orders return 42; malformed/unsupported containers and dependency failures
are checked. [Format and validation](design/extended-cli-metadata.md#direct-runtime-container-checkpoint--2026-09-30).
Feature branches and hashes are retained in the compiler validation report; this is
not published/main runtime support or a guest Introspection loader.

The Hello World acceptance slice adds explicit `NeoClrEmitOptions.ConsoleReference`
in Raven. Only the exact registered assembly symbol's System.Console.WriteLine with
a non-null string literal is mapped. The independent API's `WriteConsoleLine` emits
ldstr/call/pop; the pop consumes the existing native System method's Void value.
Direct Main output and Main calling Greet both print Hello World and exit zero through
PE/#Neo. Int32 entry/helper results remain the bounded source contract. General
Console/string signature import and native platform-call contracts remain future
replacement work; the ordinary .NET target is unchanged.

## Binary execution encoding — 2026-09-30

Raven's opt-in EmitMetadataAssembly now chooses execution schema 2, bounded CBOR,
through the independent WriteBinary API. The .NET primitive/Console reference contracts
and reference-only CLI projection are unchanged. This replaces JSON at the native
loading boundary: neoCLR preserves PE bytes and directly decodes the binary payload
to its module model. Compiler-host emission still uses JSON as an intermediate.
Schema 1 remains supported; older schema-1-only runtimes reject required schema 2.
Both versions are feature-branch experiments and are not production target contracts.

Owners remain Raven (semantic mapping), the metadata library (encoding/projection)
and neoCLR (admission/linking/verification/execution). Structural schemas and guest
Introspection APIs remain absent. Indexed native tables may replace this provisional
object encoding. [Profile, compatibility and evidence](design/extended-cli-metadata.md#binary-native-execution-profile--2026-09-30).


## Existing class-library transport baseline — 2026-09-30

NativeModuleContainer now translates the current assembled System JSON into standalone
binary NEOX, preserving native values and bypassing the restricted CLI projection.
Both Hello examples and the generic module chain execute using translated System;
all 641 IL functions verify. The independent metadata project owns transport encoding;
neoCLR owns admission and execution. No Raven Runtime Contract setting, semantic
mapping or production target registration changes in this slice. These envelopes
cannot be loaded as .NET compiler references. Direct Raven source compilation and
broader symbol projection/native import remain the next compiler work. Translated
artifacts provide a regression baseline, not independent correctness proof.


## Existing Raven application translation experiment — 2026-09-30

The legacy bridge's sample outputs are now inputs to the independent binary translation
experiment. Compiler Runtime Contract configuration and the CLI projection remain the
existing collection-profile contracts; the native JSON values are preserved through
NEOX. The matching 417-type/4,090-function System profile exceeds current binary bounds,
so application comparisons explicitly retain JSON System. This is not the same artifact
as the smaller bundled System translated previously. No compiler target capabilities
are broadened by this test. [Evidence and limitations](experiments/extended-cli-metadata/raven-sample-translation.md).


## Larger native library profile — 2026-09-30

Standalone schema 3 now transports the complete matching Raven collection System and
UInt64 instruction operands. FloatingMath, OptionPositional and ValueCopy execute with
binary application and binary System artifacts. Compiler Runtime Contracts, the legacy
CLI bridge's semantic mappings and .NET defaults do not change. The metadata library
owns the versioned encoding; neoCLR owns admission/execution. No CLI projection or native
compiler symbol provider is added. PE/#Neo remains on schema 1/2; the translator's new
schema-3 default requires the matching runtime feature branch.
[Contract and tested consumer](design/extended-cli-metadata.md#library-execution-profile-3--2026-09-30).


## Direct neoil assembly output — 2026-09-30

The runtime assembler now accepts `--format neox`, letting the existing bridge's neoil
output become a native assembly without a JSON translation step. Compiler Runtime
Contracts and semantic/emission mappings are unchanged; the assembler preserves the
root module and verifies the explicit dependency set. The independent metadata API
remains separate and checks the produced values in C# consumer tests. Full matching
System, FloatingMath, OptionPositional and ValueCopy pass. This removes an artifact
conversion stage; it does not add direct Raven native emission or compiler symbol import.
[Validation and commands](experiments/extended-cli-metadata/direct-assembly.md).

### Unit-returning native helpers and library methods — 2026-09-30

The opt-in `NeoClrCompilationEmitter` now accepts Unit/no-result functions and public
static methods with required Int32 parameters. Statement calls, explicit bare returns
and implicit fall-through returns emit through the independent Cecil-style metadata
API. An Int32 entry point can call a Unit helper without a synthetic source return value.
Imported method matching includes the result contract as well as parameter count.

Configuration remains the explicit .NET primitive binding bootstrap (`TargetPlatform.DotNet`),
unsigned output/core identities and registered `NeoClrMetadataDependency` bindings;
Console literal output additionally requires `ConsoleReference`. No Runtime Contract
setting, ordinary .NET emission or production target registration changes. Native intent
is a no-result function; the temporary CLI reference projection represents it as `void`,
which Raven binds as Unit. The native PE/#Neo schema-2 section owns execution, and the
projection contains reference-only bodies. The compiler adapter owns mapping and
validation; the separate metadata library owns encoding. A native symbol provider and
broader native backend will replace the projection/bootstrap.

C# consumer checks compile and execute four Hello variants (Int32 and Unit helpers,
explicit and implicit returns), then emit a Raven library and reload its projection into
Raven. A second compilation calls its Unit overload and returns its Int32 overload;
neoCLR verifies both assemblies and prints exactly one Hello World line with exit zero.
Rejected discarded Int32 calls, named arguments, Unit entry points and unsupported
Console mappings leave the output stream unchanged. This is bounded linear-body support:
entry points still return Int32, and generic/instance methods, general result types,
control flow and complete runtime class-library compilation remain pending.

Validation used Raven `3d6c8dbf1` on `codex/metadata-consumer`, the separate metadata
library from neoCLR `217a59a0` on `codex/extended-cli-metadata`, and the release runtime
built at `116be40e`. Raven's `tools/NeoClrMetadataProbe/validation.json` records the
compiler, adapter, metadata library, runtime and artifact hashes. The complete probe
passed, including the pre-existing multi-file and transitive-dependency checks.

### Namespaced native library types — 2026-09-30

The opt-in adapter now traverses block-scoped, nested and file-scoped namespace
members. Public nongeneric static classes retain their bound namespace and metadata
name in the independent metadata API. As with .NET type identity, two types with the
same short name in different namespaces remain distinct; imports affect Raven lookup,
not native ownership. No format change or new namespace table is needed for this slice.

The C# consumer emits `Example.First.Math` and `Example.Second.Math`, with a call
between them, in both source-file orders. It reads the resulting CLI projection,
checks both namespaces, binds an independent Raven application using imported and
qualified names, and verifies/runs each application against its binary library in
neoCLR to 42. Namespace-scoped free functions and nested types are still rejected with
source diagnostics and unchanged output: the current native function model lacks a
namespace contract, so flattening those functions would lose ownership.

Configuration remains `TargetPlatform.DotNet` for the primitive semantic bootstrap,
with explicit core/output identities and dependency bindings. Runtime Contract options
and default .NET emission are unchanged. The compiler adapter owns symbol-to-metadata
mapping, the independent library owns PE/#Neo encoding, and neoCLR loads the native
schema-2 section. CLI declarations remain a temporary reference-only representation;
a native symbol provider will replace that projection. Generic/instance members,
namespace-owned native functions and complete runtime class-library compilation remain
pending. This extends the earlier global-namespace-only compiler checkpoint.

Validation: Raven `0c13e890b` on `codex/metadata-consumer`, metadata API at neoCLR
`d075cb44` and runtime built at `116be40e`. The full C# probe and native verification/
execution pass; Raven `tools/NeoClrMetadataProbe/validation.json` records artifact hashes.
