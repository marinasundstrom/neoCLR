# neoCLR platform roadmap

**Updated 2026-09-27.** This is the authoritative default for work priorities,
milestone sequencing and scope. Explicit author directions take precedence.

## Current work

The bounded HTTP POC is [complete on macOS arm64](http-capabilities.md#finish-this-poc),
including independent peers, known-length uploads and the extracted-package check.
Feature scope is frozen; do not automatically start another HTTP feature.

**Active work is release preparation for this POC**, at the author's direction.
Publication is held for the author-requested migration of Option, Result and TaskOutcome to
standard Raven unions, using Raven.Core as the reference. This is a release
contract correction; HTTP feature scope remains frozen.
The [toolchain/release tracker](tracking/toolchain-release.md) owns efficient CI,
exact-candidate qualification and known-defect disposition. The CI split is implemented;
hosted acceptance passed all six jobs at `1404454e` (slowest 8.88 minutes);
focused union and replacement-package qualification is still required. Preview 10 is selected for the author-requested release; publication awaits
validation. Thematic tracking consolidation is complete; M2–M6 remain candidates.

## Theme trackers

Each work item has one status owner. Use that tracker for its status, remaining
scope, next evidence and linked design. Cross-theme dependencies link to their
owner; they do not create a second checklist.

| Theme | Status owner | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP and networking | [Client/server capability tracker](http-capabilities.md) | HTTP POC finish line, client/server matrix, transport limits and future protocol work |
| Runtime and language | [Runtime/language tracker](tracking/runtime-language.md) | Values, references, GC, async execution and deferred type-system/runtime experiments |
| Library and data | [Library/data tracker](tracking/library-data.md) | Text, collections, files/streams, time, introspection, JSON and general resource contracts |
| Toolchain and delivery | [Toolchain/release tracker](tracking/toolchain-release.md) | Raven integration, diagnostic debt, packaging, CI, API documentation and publication gates |

These are maintenance ownership boundaries, not an instruction to develop four
features in parallel. HTTP owns the application package acceptance decision;
tooling owns packaging procedure and general release checks.

## Milestones

Retain the application-led milestone sequence. M2–M6 remain candidate products;
reassess their ordering after M1 rather than treating the list as approved API scope.

| Milestone | Sample product | Status / scope owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 — Communicate | Hello Service + Hello Client, now the typed HTTP/JSON exchange | POC complete; release preparation active in tooling tracker |
| M2 — Work with data | File Catalog | Candidate; library/data tracker |
| M3 — Handle waiting and failure | Download Queue | Candidate; HTTP, library and runtime contracts must be selected together |
| M4 — Human time and presentation | Activity Report | Candidate; library/data tracker |
| M5 — Explain programs | Assembly Explorer | Candidate; library/data tracker, with tooling integration |
| M6 — Across hosts | Portable Sample Pack | Candidate; toolchain/release tracker |

The detailed earlier product sketches and comparisons are preserved in the
[dated roadmap](history/planning-20260927/platform-roadmap.md#milestones-at-a-glance).
An implemented supporting API does not by itself complete a milestone.

## Working rules

- Select a bounded task from the active milestone and keep its tracker and evidence
  current. A one-off author request does not silently reprioritize all future work.
- Prioritize features over optional optimization. Investigate runtime cost when it
  blocks a selected feature, materially impairs supported use, or fails a release
  criterion. Preserve defects and measurements without making indefinite profiling
  a prerequisite for unrelated work.
- At most one small companion task may accompany a larger feature. It must finish
  independently without introducing a new language, ABI, culture or lifetime contract.
- Reuse the relevant .NET/CLR comparisons in linked design notes; deepen research
  when a contract changes. Follow [design research](design-research.md). Proposals
  are exploratory inputs, not specifications or implementation commitments.
- General Raven fixes must be independently validated on a main-based feature
  branch before neoCLR integration. Keep target policies isolated; follow AGENTS.md.
- Distinguish implemented source, tested development artifacts, packaged evidence
  and released behavior. Public APIs require matching reference documentation.
  Runtime release and website publication remain separate operations.

## Maintaining tracking

Put current status and next actions in the owning theme tracker. Put contracts,
alternatives and primary-source comparisons in design notes, commands/results in
experiment records, implemented changes in the changelog, and significant direction
exchanges in the development timeline. Do not append a new “current priority” section
to an older roadmap. Update the existing status row and preserve prior decisions as
history when they matter. Add a new theme only when existing ownership cannot fit it.

The 2026-09-26 issue inventory has been assigned across the theme trackers. It is a
dated inventory, not a fresh GitHub status check. Original issue details and all nine
Raven issue assessments remain in the [archived triage](history/planning-20260927/issue-fix-roadmap.md).
No issues were closed or implementations revalidated by this documentation change.
