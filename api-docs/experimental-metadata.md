# Experimental .NET metadata envelope library

**Feature-branch development only; not part of Preview 11 or the neoCLR guest API.**
Assembly and namespace: `NeoCLR.Metadata.Experimental`. Target: .NET 10.
Source project: `tools/metadata/NeoCLR.Metadata.Experimental`.
This is the first reusable reader/writer slice intended for Raven's future symbol
loader and code-generation adapters. It reads/writes **NEOX 0.1 framing only**.
No PE/CLI loading, artifact recognition, structural decoding, reference resolution,
Introspection assembly loading or assembly emission is implemented by this library yet.

## Namespace and types

- [MetadataSection](#metadatasection): immutable, owned opaque payload and section metadata.
- [MetadataEnvelope](#metadataenvelope): bounded envelope read/write operations.

These .NET-host-only types have this complete manual reference because the site's
RavenDoc source is the neoCLR guest compiler-reference assembly. They are not omitted
guest types or claimed executable neoCLR APIs. The maintenance record names this
boundary explicitly; source XML documentation also ships beside the built .NET DLL.

## MetadataSection

```csharp
public sealed class MetadataSection
{
    public MetadataSection(ushort kind, ushort version, bool required,
                           ReadOnlySpan<byte> payload);
    public ushort Kind { get; }
    public ushort Version { get; }
    public bool Required { get; }
    public int PayloadLength { get; }
    public byte[] GetPayload();
}
```

The constructor requires nonzero `kind` and `version` and at most 1 MiB of payload.
It copies the span into private storage. Invalid arguments raise
`ArgumentOutOfRangeException`. The payload-size limit does not imply the section fits
inside a complete envelope; headers also consume its 1 MiB budget.

`Kind` and `Version` identify the section schema. `Required` determines whether an
exact schema match is required by the consuming layer. `PayloadLength` is the byte
count. `GetPayload()` returns a new caller-owned byte array on each call; changing it
or the constructor's original buffer cannot change this section. Payload semantics
are not interpreted. A supported schema dictionary alone does not establish that a
payload is valid or executable.

## MetadataEnvelope

```csharp
public static class MetadataEnvelope
{
    public const int MaxImageSize = 1048576;
    public const int MaxSections = 64;
    public static IReadOnlyList<MetadataSection> Read(
        ReadOnlySpan<byte> image,
        IReadOnlyDictionary<ushort, ushort> supportedSchemas);
    public static byte[] Write(
        IReadOnlyList<MetadataSection> sections,
        IReadOnlyDictionary<ushort, ushort> supportedSchemas);
}
```

`Read` takes one complete image. It validates magic/version, size/count limits,
nonzero unique section kinds/versions, known flags, canonical contiguous ranges and
required schemas. It returns a read-only section list with owned payload copies, in
input order; the input buffer is no longer needed after the call. Unknown optional
schemas are retained byte-for-byte. Unknown required schemas fail. An empty dictionary
admits only optional sections. Callers must not mutate inputs during a call.

`Write` takes sections in desired output order, validates duplicate kinds, total size
and required schemas, and returns a new caller-owned image. Empty envelopes and
zero-length payloads are supported. Both operations reject malformed/unsupported
framing with `InvalidDataException`; null list/dictionary arguments raise
`ArgumentNullException`. A null section entry raises `InvalidDataException`.
The helpers perform no file I/O or assembly loading.

The schema dictionary maps each kind to one admitted schema version. It is an explicit
capability declaration supplied by the higher-level consumer, which must still decode
and validate known payloads. These framing routines cannot be used by themselves as
semantic acceptance for Raven or neoCLR. Preserving opaque bytes does not validate a
rewrite of the declarations/tokens to which they might refer.

The current NEOX layout preserves section order and exact payload bytes and rejects
gaps/overlaps/trailing data. Reading then writing a valid image therefore reproduces
its bytes. This is deterministic framing, not structural type canonicalization.
Copies simplify ownership at a memory cost; no zero-copy/performance claim is made.

## Example and validation

The separate `tools/metadata/MetadataConformance` executable builds this example
against the project reference and tests it through Python's independent reader:

```csharp
var schemas = new Dictionary<ushort, ushort> { [7] = 2 };
var bytes = MetadataEnvelope.Write(
    [new MetadataSection(7, 2, true, "abc"u8),
     new MetadataSection(60000, 9, false, [0, 255, 0])], schemas);
var sections = MetadataEnvelope.Read(bytes, schemas);
```

Kinds 7 and 60000 here are opaque test payloads, not production declarations.

```sh
python3 docs/experiments/extended-cli-metadata/verify_dotnet.py
```

Four shared fixtures round-trip identically through .NET. Independently emitted .NET
bytes match Python emission; both reject 49 malformed vectors. The consumer also
checks required-schema mismatch, writer limits, unknown optional preservation and
buffer ownership. The reference assembly/source snapshot check remains unchanged and
passes; there are no new guest reference types in this slice.
