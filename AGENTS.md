# Repository workflow

## Changelog required for every commit

- Include a staged `CHANGELOG.md` update in every commit, including code, tests,
  documentation, tooling and maintenance commits.
- Make development updates under `Unreleased`, grouped by the current date.
  Revise or extend a related entry from the same date instead of duplicating it.
  Add an entry for a different subject or a later date.
- Keep published changelog sections and published release notes unchanged.
  Record any correction under `Unreleased`, referring to the affected release.
- Describe implemented behavior accurately; label plans as plans and include
  material compatibility or migration notes. Do not invent a release version/date.
- Before committing, review the staged changelog alongside the changes and run
  `git diff --cached --check`.

See [the changelog workflow](docs/changelog.md) for consolidation and release handling.

## Research-backed platform design

- Frame every roadmap capability and substantive improvement to existing features
  as a comparison with .NET/CLR APIs, behavior and implementation layers.
- Follow [design research](docs/design-research.md): use primary sources, distinguish
  shipped behavior from proposals, compare alternatives and record tradeoffs.
- Do not call a divergence an improvement without explaining its benefit and costs.
  Reuse existing research for routine fixes; deepen it when contracts or assumptions change.
- Record provisional choices and validation needs. This process is not an additional
  approval requirement and does not override authorized work.
